#  About this project

```$xslt
The go files in this directory was my first go project at university.
It modeled three different version of the same problem, a queue of students
needing to talk to a their lecturer about a problem they are having.

In part one the queue will keep building regardless of how many students come.
In part two students will leave if the queue is too long.
In part three there are two lecturers available to help with answering the
students questions.
